 [ ? ] Why does addr2line do some black magic on elf addresses
 [ ? ] why is there an offset for the caller address
 [ ? ] profiling multithreaded applications
 [ ? ] interpolation for events that do not have distinguishable times (should not happen until 2080)
 [ ? ] the instrumentation time of functions are accounted as self time of their parents - sums up for functions with many children calls. can we avoid that somehow?
 [ ? ] is there an alternative for the deprecated malloc hooks
 [ ? ] can the readability of the absolute times in the flat profile be improved?
