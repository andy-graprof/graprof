open issues
 [ 9 ] calls to the instrumenting funcions are made *after* the function entry and *before* the function exit. This, and the calling times for the instrumenting functions themselves adds up if the function calls a lot of children, and produces inaccurate results depending on code structure and trace data. This is not good.
 [ 5 ] profiling multithreaded applications
 [ 6 ] I know the parent function of orphaned functions. sometimes these are real parents with "missing links" sometimes they are not. can I do something here?
