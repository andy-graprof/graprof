open issues
 [ 9 ] calls to the instrumenting funcions are made *after* the function entry and *before* the function exit. This, and the calling times for the instrumenting functions themselves adds up if the function calls a lot of children, and produces inaccurate results depending on code structure and trace data. This is not good.
