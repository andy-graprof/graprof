 [ 9 ] trace visualization

tasks (marked with * are necessary for next 0.6 release)
 [ 1 ] configure flag to turn off gui and/or instrumentation and/or memory hooks
 [ 1 ] make highrestimer clock configurable
 [ 4 ] profile different methods of hook activation / deactivation
 [ 2 ] sort inner output in call graph
 [ 3 ] function traversation is too slow.
 [ 4 ] tracing lib is proably too slow as well
 [ 1 ] remove fprintf cascades in favour of constant string macros
 [ 4 ] improve website
         - main page is unclear
         - missing documentation
         - ...
 [*6 ] look into alternative invokation style
 [ 99] read guide!
 [ 2 ] include stefan in AUTHORS file

questions
 [ 5 ] Why does addr2line do some black magic on elf addresses
 [ 9 ] Can I write traces on crash?
 
open issues
 [ 9 ] calls to the instrumenting funcions are made *after* the function entry and *before* the function exit. This, and the calling times for the instrumenting functions themselves adds up if the function calls a lot of children, and produces inaccurate results depending on code structure and trace data. This is not good.
 [ 5 ] profiling multithreaded applications
 [ 6 ] I know the parent function of orphaned functions. sometimes these are real parents with "missing links" sometimes they are not. can I do something here?
 [ 4 ] sometimes, (why?) inlined functions can not be translated to their corresponding debug symbols. addr2line is unable to do that as well
 [ 5 ] currently, I have no means of checking if a given trace was generated with the given binary. graprof may segfault on mismatch - is this bad?
