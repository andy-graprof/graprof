	* graprof/bitmask.h: adding width field in bitmask structure
	* graprof/bitmask.c: setting width in bitmask_create and bitmask_copy;
	using calloc instead of malloc for bitmask field to avoid errors in
	bitmask_get

	* graprof/callgraph.c: added percentage of children time to callee
	prints in callgraph_print

2013-10-25  Andreas Grapentin  <andreas@grapentin.org>

	* graprof/function.c: fixed function_compare for NULL pointer function
	arguments
	* graprof/memory.c: storing caller addresses for failed_* structs
	* graprof/memprofile.c: tweaked printing procedures to properly
	accomodate where failed allocations come from

	* libgraprof/mallhooks.c: calling __libc* malloc family functions instead of
	pure {m,c,re}alloc, free - fixes problems where the active switch is
	set asynchronously. Additionally, the hooks now distinguish malloc and
	calloc, which is not visible in the resulting traces yet.

2013-08-30  Andreas Grapentin  <andreas@grapentin.org>

	* libgraprof/libgraprof.c: minor change to const char* errors

	perror, effectively removing the grapes dependency of libgraprof

2013-08-27  Andreas Grapentin  <andreas@grapentin.org>

	* graprof/function.c: added total function count incremented in
	function_enter, and added accessor function definition

2013-08-26  Andreas Grapentin  <andreas@grapentin.org>

	* graprof/flatprofile.c: fixed profile header and description
	* graprof/flatprofile.c: if call graph and flat profile are enabled,
	print function ids in flat profile

	* graprof/memory.c: fixed allocation tracking bug if already freed
	locations are allocated again
	* graprof/memprofile.c: removed distinction between invalid ptr and
	double free

	* graprof/flatprofile.h: added parameter to tell flatprofile_print to
	enable function id printing
	* graprof/flatprofile.c: implemented the behaviour of this parameter
	* graprof/graprof.c: changed call to flatprofile_print accordingly

2013-08-25  Andreas Grapentin  <andreas@grapentin.org>

	* libgraprof/highrestimer.c: removed function pointer approach, added
	proper error handling, made highrestimer_init static
