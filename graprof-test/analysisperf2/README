This experiment is intended to evaluate the libgraprof timing overhead and
the performance of the analysis tool.

To evaluate the libgraprof timing overhead, the tool should be configured
with --enable-libgraprof-timing.
To evaluate the performance of the analysis tool, the project should be
configured without --enable-libgraprof-timing, to remove the additional
overhead introduced by the timing operations.
