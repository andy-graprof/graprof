Version 0.6

* Changed invocation style to allow in-place execution of profiling child

* Notable performance increase in address translation and function comparison, 
  which is done A LOT.

* added trace file verification by comparing md5 sums of generating binary and
  binary passed to the analysis

* Fixed a bug where the analysis would crash if an address could be resolved
  to a function name but not a file or vice versa

* lots of minor tweaks and fixes


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.5

* This is the first beta release intended for public use. It requires the
  complete GNU toolchain, as well as the GNU C Library in a non-ancient
  version.

* Added a tracing library that hooks entry and exit calls to functions that
  are compiled with -finstrument-functions.

* Added runtime analysis comparable to that of gprof, with a couple of 
  differences that are subject to change.

* Added memory analysis comparable to that of mtrace, again with a couple
  of differences that are subject to change.
