1. Introduction
---------------

 The development of graprof has been inspired by the profiling tools gprof and
 mtrace, and their inability to work together. Based on the most basic 
 profiling methods the GNU toolchain has to offer, graprof aims to provice a
 low-impact, high-precision profiling method, as well as a high-detail trace
 analysis tool which, sadly, is not yet implemented as of the current 0.5 
 release.
